# Background

Hi, I'm Ethan! I live in Fort Lee, New Jersey.  

I like to make electronic music with hardware synthesizers.  

I like a variety of games including board games, video games, and Dungeons and Dragons.  

I bake bread, pizza, and desserts from scratch with hand-milled wheat.  

I am married with a wife and two daughters.  

I used to work in investment banking operations trade support at Barclays Capital and Nomura Securities.  

During that time, I became more fascinated with data analytics and data processing and joined Samsung supporting customer warranties.  

To further my analytics and leadership skills, I attended Rutgers Business School and received my MBA.  

I joined New Street Research where I deployed a modern analytics stack and an NLP app using streaming Twitter data.  

I currently consult on data science and data engineering projects and am in the market for new opportunities!
